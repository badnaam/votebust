  <%= t 'site_name' %> encourages the community to actively participate in votes by awarding Voting Power. Voting Power allows you to create more visibility for the votes you start
  (see <a href="#featured_votes">Featured Votes</a>) and have more community users to vote on the votes you have started.
  Of course, it builds your influence as an active participant as well!

    <li class="bld">How do I earn Voting Power?</li>
    <p>
      Voting power can be earned the the following ways</p>
    <ul>
      <li >By completing your registration - <span class="bld">10 Voting Power.</span></li>
      <li >By voting on a vote start by another user - <span class="bld">1 Voting Power per vote.</span> </li>
      <li >By Voting on a Featured Vote - <span class="bld">Featured votes offer more Voting Power. Look for this
          <span class="flag-wrapper"><span class='bld power-points'>X</span></span> to see
          how many voting power a featured vote offers</li>
      <li>Anytime another user adds your vote to their tracking list.</li>
    </ul>

    <li class="bld">
      How do I use VotingPower?</li>
    <p> 
      <strong>You need to earn at least <span class="bld">50 Voting Power</span> to start using your Voting Power.</strong>
      
      Voting power can be used to promote your votes into the <a href="#featured_votes">Featured Votes</a> list. Featured votes appear on the home page and award more Voting
      Power to the voters. Hence they have more visibility and attract more voters.
      While creating a vote, simply choose how much of your Voting Power you wish to give up
      for your vote to be in the Featured Vote list. The more Voting Power you offer the higher up the your vote is in the list. The Top 10 Featured Votes are displayed on the
      home page.

    <p>
      For example : 
      If you offer 30 Voting Power the voters who vote on that particular vote topic will earn <span class="flag-wrapper"><span class="bld power-points">3</span></span> (30 / 10) Voting Power.
    </p>
    </p>
    <li class="bld">How do I check how much Voting Power I have?</li>
    <p>
      The <strong>influece</strong> tab in your profile page shows your voting power and the activity you have generated in the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voter's earned voting power is displayed inside the Voting Power icon <span class="vote-power-ubox t-trigger">icon</span>.
      It is also displayed at the toolbar the at the
