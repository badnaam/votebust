<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>The Types of Information <%= t 'site_name' %> Collects</strong>.
    We collect any information you enter
		on the Service or give us in any other way (such as through an
		email, survey, or letter). The information that we collect varies
		depending upon how you use our Service. Our account registration
		process requires that you provide us with your user name, zip code, age, gender
		and email address, and that you create and provide us with a
		password. We may also request other information, such as but not
		limited to, third party authentication information.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Information in Public
		Areas of the Site</strong>.

    Please keep in mind that whenever you
		voluntarily provide information in public areas of the Service,
		such as the user profile pages or comments, that information can be
		viewed and possibly used by others. We therefore advise visitors
		not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email
		address, street address or instant messenger address (within these
		public areas) that they do not wish to share. We are not
		responsible for PII you choose to submit in these public areas.
		Also, we may highlight content you post to the public areas of the
		Service such as vote topics or comments, such as by featuring your
		content on the Site's home page.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facebook/Google/Twitter/Yahoo</strong>.
    As an optional service, we offer users the ability to integrate their
		Facebook/Google/Twitter/Yahoo accounts with <%= t 'site_name' %> for authentication. We also offer users the ability to share
    content from voteable on their Facebook profile/wall etc. See Section V below for more
		information on the types of information we collect from the use of
		this service.

<p class="bld">AUTOMATIC INFORMATION COLLECTION.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cookies</strong>.
    Like many websites, we use
    &quot;cookies.&quot; Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we

		identifying cookies to remember your information and to link your
		activities to you. While you can take steps to warn off, block or
		disable cookies, if you do, the Service may not function and appear
		as we have designed it. Nonetheless, if you want to take these
		steps, you can do so by following the instructions associated with
		your browser. Our cookies collect
		information such as the following:
    <ol>
      <li>the domain name and host from
			which you access the Internet and the Internet address of the site
			from which you direct-linked to ours;
      </li>
      <li>the date and time you access the
			Site and pages you visit;
      </li>

			browser type and version you use;
      </li>
      <li>demographic and other
			non-personally identifiable profile information about you; and
      </li>
      <li>information to combat fraud or
			misuse.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pixel Tags</strong>. In
		our email to you, we use &quot;pixel tags&quot; to determine if
		your email software or service can display html-formatted email
		(this helps us optimize the size of our email messages and conserve
		bandwith).
  </li>
  <li><strong>Collection of Information by Third Parties</strong>.
		Some of the advertisers and other businesses that advertise or
		place other content our Site use cookies on our Site and may place
		a cookie on your computer. The content posted by these businesses
		will be identified as coming from a third party. In addition, we
		use third party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies
		(1) use information obtained from your visits to this Site and
		other sites to serve ads to you and (2) place unique third party
		cookies on your browser. Also, we use web beacons provided by third
		party advertising companies to help optimize our advertising. Web
		beacons enable us to recognize your browser when a cookie has been
		placed on your computer. Some but not all third party advertising
		companies provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology. For
		more information and an identification of advertisers that provide
		an opt-out mechanism, please click the following:
    <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.
    <p>The information collected by third party cookies is subject to
		the privacy policy of the third party, not <%= t 'site_name' %>'s privacy
		policy.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Promotions, Sweepstakes,
		and Contests</strong>.
    From time to time, we may host a promotion,
		sweepstake, or contest on the Service. You May be asked to provide

		your choice whether or not you wish to permit such transfer to our
		collection of personal information by a third party.
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="bld"><%= "#{t 'site_name'}'s" %> USE AND RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>
      Use of PII</strong>.

    We
		use your PII for purposes such as responding to your requests;
		monitoring and providing the Service; maintaining your <%= t 'site_name' %>
		account; providing you with advertising and non-advertising content
		that we believe would be of interest to you; enforcing our rights
		and the rights of third parties, and investigating and ensuring
		compliance with the <a href="/terms">Terms</a>.
		We also may use your PII to contact you regarding your account,
		such as to inform you that you have received an email from another
    <%= t 'site_name' %> member, or to forward user comments to you about the
		content that you have posted. We may also email <%= t 'site_name' %>
		newsletters, and similar communications about the Service.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Use of Other Information</strong>.

		We use non-PII about our users for purposes such as measuring the
		number of visitors to sections of our Site, making the Service more
		useful to visitors and delivering targeted advertising and
		non-advertising content. We use IP addresses to analyze trends,
		administer the Site, track a user's movement, and gather broad
		demographic information for aggregate, non-personally identifiable
		use.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Retention of Information</strong>.
		We retain information for as long as required, allowed or we
		believe it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations. We
		may dispose of information in our discretion without notice,
		subject to applicable law that specifically requires the handling
		or retention of information. You must keep your own, separate
		back-up records.
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="bld"><%= "#{t 'site_name'}'s" %> SHARING OF INFORMATION.</p>
<p><%= t 'site_name' %> shares information with third parties, but only as
	described in this Section 4.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Advertisers and Others</strong>.
		We share non-personally identifiable information with advertisers,
		service providers, and other persons with whom we conduct business.
		Conversely, these advertisers, service providers, and other persons
		may share with us non-PII about you that they have independently
		developed or acquired.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Service Third Parties</strong>.
		We contract with affiliated and non-affiliated third parties to
		provide services to us or to you on our behalf. Examples include
		providing marketing assistance, providing customer services,
		sending <%= t 'site_name' %> email to you, removing repetitive information
		from customer lists, and analyzing data. These third parties have
		access to personal information needed to perform their functions.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Business Transfer</strong>.
		As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or
		their assets, or engage in acquisitions, merger, restructurings,
		changes or control, or similar transactions. In such transactions,
		customer information generally is one of the transferred business
		assets, and your PII is subject to such a transfer. Also, in the
		unlikely event of a bankruptcy, customer information may be
		transferred to a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession and
		then to a subsequent purchaser.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Affiliates</strong>. We

		may share PII, non-PII and other information with our corporate
		affiliates. Corporate affiliates are those entities that we
		control, are controlled by us, or are under common control with us
		and any joint venture in which any of the controlled entities may
		participate from time to time. Any use of your information by our
		corporate affiliates is subject to this Policy or another policy no
		less protective of your privacy. Likewise, we may obtain
		information about you from our corporate affiliates or from your
		visits to other web sites that we or our corporate affiliates
		control. We may share information about you with our corporate
		affiliates and our corporate affiliates may share information with
		us using cookie or any other available technology.
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Compliance and Safety</strong>. We may release user
		information when we believe release is appropriate to: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>comply with applicable law, and
			to respond to legal process, including subpoenas, search warrants
			and court orders, and to respond to or otherwise address written
			complaints of copyright infringement;
      </li>
      <li>make disclosures under programs
			intended to prevent potential crimes or investigate persons;
      </li>
      <li>enforce or apply agreements,
			including the Terms; or
      </li>
      <li>protect the rights, property, or
			safety of <%= t 'site_name' %>, our users, or others, including exchanging
			information with other companies for fraud protection and credit
			risk reduction.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="bld">Faceboo/Google/Twitter/Yahoo.</p>
<p>This section is only applicable to users who choose to integrate
	their Faceboo/Google/Twitter/Yahoo accounts with <%= t 'site_name' %>.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>
      The Types of Information
		We Collect</strong>. 
    We use Faceboo/Google/Twitter/Yahoo OpenGraph and/or Oauth and/or OpenId authentication features (the 'API'), so that you
		can use your existing Faceboo/Google/Twitter/Yahoo account to access the features
		of the Site. We may use a third party authentication service provider such as Janrain.com to make this feature work.
    You must explicitly authorize Faceboo/Google/Twitter/Yahoo to share your
		information with us when you first login to the Site with your
		Faceboo/Google/Twitter/Yahoo credentials.<BR><BR>You should review your privacy
		settings on your Facebook account because those settings determine
		what PII is made available to us when you access the Site. While
		the Faceboo/Google/Twitter/Yahoo Oauth/OpenID/OpenGraph features allows us to access and store a host of
		information about you, we only access and store PII which we feel
		is useful to enhance your experience of the Site or functionality provided by us, such as processing of votes for reporting.
    When you first
		create an account with us through the Faceboo/Google/Twitter/Yahoo API , we
		access and store your name, public &quot;About Me&quot;
		information, your email address, your Facebook user id number, and
		your Facebook URL. We may also pull your friends list (their first and
		last names and Facebook user id numbers), but only keep a record of
		your connection to them if your friends have also created accounts
		with the Site. We do NOT store any data about any of your Facebook
		friends if they don't already have their own Site accounts. Each
		time you login to the Site we check your friends list from Facebook
		to see if any of your friends have signed up for the Site since you
		last visited so they can appear as part of your <%= t 'site_name' %> network
		of friends.<BR><BR>Facebook also gives us access to your (and your
		friends') main profile photos, if those photos are public. We do
		not store those photos ourselves; rather, we serve them directly
		from Facebook's servers.<BR><BR>We may store your birthdate if you
		make it public on your Facebook profile.<BR><BR>We collect any
		information you enter on the Site or give us in any other way (such
		as through an email, survey, or letter). The information that we
		collect varies depending upon how you use our Site.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Terminating your Account</strong>.
		You may discontinue this service at any time by removing your
    <%= t 'site_name' %> account under the &quot;Applications and Websites&quot;
		section of your Faceboo/Google/Twitter/Yahoo Privacy Settings. This will remove all
		references to you and your data from display on Faceboo/Google/Twitter/Yahoo, but will
		not affect your Faceboo/Google/Twitter/Yahoo account.
  </li>
</ol>
<p class="bld">INFORMATION SECURITY</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Your Obligations</strong>.
		You must protect against unauthorized access to your password and
		to your computer. Please sign off when finished using a shared
		computer. Your emails to us are not necessarily secure against
		interception so do not include sensitive information in them - we
		generally will not ask for passwords in an email and you should
		assume that if you get such a request, it might be fraudulent. YOU
		MUST DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR
		PERSONAL INFORMATION.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Our Security Measures</strong>.
		We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help
		safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and
		correctly use your information. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE
		SECURITY. Neither people nor security systems are foolproof,
		including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit
		intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. If
		applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty (if any), you
		agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to
		measure our compliance with that duty.
  </li>
</ul>

	want to stop receiving these communications, you may opt by going to
	the Profile tab on the Site and editing your email preferences.</p>
<p class="bld">ACCESS AND RECORD KEEPING.</p>

	maintained in a retrievable form. However, you may make changes,
	corrections or updates to some PII provided through the Service
	which we use for communications with you, by going to the &quot;
	Profile&quot; tab on the Site. We may keep a record of all
	information that is changed. We may determine what may be changed.

	transactions, you may be prevented from changing relevant
	information.</p>
