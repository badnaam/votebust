  Votechek encourages the community in actively participating in votes by awarding Voting Power. Voting Power allows you to create more visibility for the votes you start (see
  <a href="#featured_votes">Featured Votes</a>) and have more community users to vote on your vote topic. Of course, it builds your reputation as an active participant as well!
  Voting Power once earned don't expire!
<ul>
  <li class="bld">How do I earn VotingPower?</li>
  <p>
    Voting power can be earned the the following ways</p>
  <ul>
    <li >By completing your registration - <span class="bld">10 Voting Power.</span></li>
    <li >By voting on a vote start by another user - <span class="bld">1 Voting Power per vote.</span> </li>
    <li >By Voting on a Featured Vote - <span class="bld">Featured votes offer more Voting Power. Look for this <span class="bld vote-power">icon</span> to see
        how many voting power a featured vote offers.</span></li>
    <li >By creating a vote that is promoted to <span class="bld"><a href="#top-trend">Top Trends</a></span> list - <span class="bld">20 Voting Power.</span></li>
  </ul>

  <li class="bld">
    How do I use VotingPower?</li>
  <p> You need to earn at least <span class="bld">50 Voting Power</span> to start using your Voting Power.
    Voting power can be used to promote your votes into the <a href="#featured_votes">Featured Votes</a> list. Featured votes appear on the home page and award more Voting
    Power to the voters. Hence they have more visibility and attract more voters.
    <br/><br/>
    While creating a vote, simply choose how much of your Voting Power you wish to give up
    for your vote to be in the Featured Vote list. The more Voting Power you offer the higher up the your vote is in the list. The Top 10 Featured Votes are displayed on the
    home page.
    <br/><br/>
    <span class="bld">For example :</span>
    <br/>
    If you offer 30 Voting Power the voters who vote on that particular vote topic will earn <span class="bld vote-power">3</span> (30 / 10) Voting Power.
    <br/><br/>
    If you offer 100 Voting Power the voters who vote on that particular vote topic will earn <span class="bld vote-power">10</span> (100 / 10) Voting Power.
    <br/><br/>
    If among all the active votes, the highest Voting Power offered is 20 and you offer 30 then your vote will be at the top of the Featured Vote list
  </p>
  <li class="bld">
    Can I loose Voting Power?
  </li>

    Though VotingPower once earned are always there, canceling a vote results in loss of Voting Power that was acquired when you voted on a VoteTopic.
  </p>
  <li class="bld">How do I check how much Voting Power I have?</li>
  <p>
    Your earned voting power is displayed inside the VotingPower icon <span class="bld vote-power">icon</span>. You can check it in your account's page by clicking on the
    <span class="bld">Profile</span> link in the main navigation menu. It is also displayed at the toolbar the at the top of the page when you are logged it or next to your
    username at various places on Votechek (For example, in the comments section).

    Provide additional details or links when possible and applicable.
  </li>

    to the vote you started, so that they can join and vote!

  </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="bld" name="not_approved">Why wasn't my vote approved?</h3>
<p>
  The moderator may not approve a Vote if it violates the <a href="terms" class="" id="">
    terms</a> of use of Votechek. You will be sent a notification when if this happens, if you have opted to receive
  email notifications. You can also check the status of your vote in your profile page by clicking on the "Profile" link on the main navigation menu.
</p>
<h3 class="bld">How do we analyze the votes?</h3>
<p>
  Votes are recorded and the counts are tallied as soon as you vote. The vote counts presented on a Vote Topic page are real time. We also periodically analyze the vote to
  provide additional insights about a Vote Topic. This information appears in the Vote Topic page, in the "About the voters" section.
</p>

<h3 class="bld">
  What is considered spam?
</h3>
<p>
  Vote Topics, Why explanations are considered spam when it is obvious that someone is trying to promote a product or a website through posting a question or answer.
  If a relevant website is posted with a genuine question (for example in the "details" field), the Vote will be kept active.
  Similarly, a "why explanation" can contain a website that directly addresses the question. However, if the same link is submitted multiple times,
  mostly to questions for which it is irrelevant, or it links to a spam site, the answer will be considered spam and removed.
</p>

<h3 class="bld">What is considered offensive?</h3>
<p>
  Generally, anything that couldn't be shown on U.S. broadcast television is considered offensive. This includes anything you post on the site, including questions,
  answers, comments, user profile information, links, avatars and usernames. While we encourage you to express yourself freely, this cannot impinge upon others'
  right to a positive Votechek experience.

  Questions on the this site must be appropriate for users aged 14 and above.Question context and category factors in as well: Some questions that might be
  offensive in one category can be appropriate in another.For example, you can talk about sex in the Relationship Advice category but not Kids, or you can use
  profanity in Word Origins, but usually not elsewhere.
</p>

Here are some general guidelines for offensive content.

<ul class="" id="">
  <li>
    The content doesn't meet the broadcast TV rule of thumb.
  </li>
  <li>
    An individual user is being attacked.
  </li>
  <li>
    The question is intended to be malicious or hurtful, in the opinion of site moderators.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Sometimes opinions may seem offensive, and some questions are intended to challenge the way others think. We tend to be careful about censoring these types of questions,
  and err on the side of preserving content. Within the larger goal of preserving a useful and harmonious community, we believe in people's right to speak their mind, and
  we have found that allowing questions that may seem offensive can lead to very thought-provoking discussions about why the question is or is not offensive.
  We recognize that this is a fine line and can involve some very tough judgment calls. If you feel that a flag was accepted or rejected erroneously, let us know by clicking
  the "Contact Us" link at the bottom of the page and submitting the details in your description. Be sure to include a link to the question and why you think the
  acceptance/rejection was erroneous.
