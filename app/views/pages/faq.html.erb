    <h3 class="bld prepend-top" id="spam">
      What is considered spam?
    </h3>
    <div>
      Vote Topics, Why explanations are considered spam when it is obvious that someone is trying to promote a product or a website through posting a question or answer.
      If a relevant website is posted with a genuine question (for example in the "details" field), the Vote will be kept active.
      Similarly, a "why explanation" can contain a website that directly addresses the question. However, if the same link is submitted multiple times,
      mostly to questions for which it is irrelevant, or it links to a spam site, the answer will be considered spam and removed.
    </div>

    <a href="#toc" class="prepend-top append-bottom">Back to Top</a>

    <h3 class="bld prepend-top" id="offensive">What is considered offensive?</h3>
    <div>
      Generally, anything that couldn't be shown on U.S. broadcast television is considered offensive. This includes anything you post on the site, including questions,
      answers, comments, user profile information, links, avatars and usernames. While we encourage you to express yourself freely, this cannot impinge upon others'
      right to a positive <%= t 'site_name' %> experience.

      Questions on the this site must be appropriate for users aged 14 and above.Question context and category factors in as well: Some questions that might be
      offensive in one category can be appropriate in another.For example, you can talk about sex in the Relationship Advice category but not Kids, or you can use
      profanity in Word Origins, but usually not elsewhere.


      Here are some general guidelines for offensive content.

      <ul class="" id="">
        <li>
          The content doesn't meet the broadcast TV rule of thumb.
        </li>
        <li>
          An individual user is being attacked.
        </li>
        <li>
          The question is intended to be malicious or hurtful, in the opinion of site moderators.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sometimes opinions may seem offensive, and some questions are intended to challenge the way others think. We tend to be careful about censoring these types of questions,
        and err on the side of preserving content. Within the larger goal of preserving a useful and harmonious community, we believe in people's right to speak their mind, and
        we have found that allowing questions that may seem offensive can lead to very thought-provoking discussions about why the question is or is not offensive.
        We recognize that this is a fine line and can involve some very tough judgment calls. If you feel that a flag was accepted or rejected erroneously, let us know by clicking
        the "Contact Us" link at the bottom of the page and submitting the details in your description. Be sure to include a link to the question and why you think the
        acceptance/rejection was erroneous.
